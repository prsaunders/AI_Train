Version 0.1.5
Adding Speed and Motion Direction routines
Commented out all references to mMilesToNext and lMilesToNext. Main Speed and Local Speed are there.
Added Express feature to Local and Main Lines.
Added to Express mode; showing the station name when the train is in range of the station.
Added a Constant, Main_Over_Local, to Switch between to get to station AND Main stopping at station on the Main Line. (setable via gui???)
Many fixes
Changed Version number format to x.vvv
Current version is 1.004
Added Tests to main menu. This allows setting Detector simulator to allow remote testing with out the need to have a train run over the tracks. Especially helpfull if you have a cat "helper"
Version 2 will be a new layout (4' x 8'); where the main does not need to go over the local line and the Lego City train station 7937 can be used. The only time the Main line will have to cross the local line will be when it needs to change direction. Local only has to stop out of the way. May also add City station 60035 to Local line. Near main line station.
